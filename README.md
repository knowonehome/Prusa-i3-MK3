# Prusa-i3-MK3

I am building a Prusa i3 MK3 “clone”, out of parts bought from different sellers and stores, basically as cheap as possible while still being as close to the “real deal” as possible while not spending money on stuff that is not essential to the benefits of the MK3.

In this repo, I upload files for the project, e.g. modified CAD files.
